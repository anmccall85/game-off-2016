Battles are turn based with a queue. each entity is allowed a move an action.
actions taken last entire rounds until the characters next turn.
There is no hp but 3 numbers (CPU, RAM, BAN) If any are taken to 0, you're booted (death)
To take out an entity, you must use team efforts to bring one of these numbers down.
Ideally, if an entity stops an attack, the number rises back to its value.
